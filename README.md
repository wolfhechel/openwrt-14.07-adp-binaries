# Advanced Data Path support files for Clearfog Pro OpenWRT 14.07

These binaries were released within a compiled OpenWRT 14.07 image (likely openwrt-14.07-a38x-dl-15t1).

The image was accessible without agreeing to any license agreements, so these files should be considered publicly accessibly.

However, the original image has since been removed so I'm keeping these binaries for posterity and future potential use-cases.
